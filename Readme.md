# GPT-3 (OpenAI) Semantic Search example

## OpenAI Embeddings

This repo is based on the reinteractive article
[Creating an Intelligent Knowledge Base Q&A App with GPT-3 andÂ Ruby](https://medium.com/@kane.hooper/creating-an-intelligent-knowledge-base-q-a-app-with-gpt-3-and-ruby-646744eb6e4)


The purpose of this file is to provide an example of how to use OpenAI embeddings to create
a knowledge base Q&A. The technology implements semantic search

This example has two major Ruby files:

1. embeddings.rb
2. questions.rb

The embeddings rb file converts any text files in the /training-data folder into vector embeddings.
The questions rb file is used to ask GPT-3 questions about the training data and return meaningful
answers.

You can provide any text files in the training-data, with the following conditions:

1. The file must be a txt file.
2. The text should have a maximum of 2000 words.

If you have a document greater than 2000 words you will need to split it up into multiple pages.

## Setup

`bundle install`

## Preparing training data

The data you want to prepare should be saved into the training-data folder. Each file needs to be a text file and have a maximum of 2000 words.
